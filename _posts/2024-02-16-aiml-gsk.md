- **Carragher Lab**: Collaborations with postdoctoral researchers at Carragher Lab, Edinburgh on publications in the space of multi-view machine learning. 

#### :bulb: Project Highlights:
- **Contributions to Multiomics Research**: Published research in multiomics data integration, contributing to cutting-edge advancements in the field, and enhancing understanding of complex biological interactions.

- **Scalable ETL Pipeline Implementation**: Engineered scalable ETL pipelines for RNA structure prediction datasets at the terabyte (TB) scale, leveraging Dask to enable efficient handling of large-scale data processing tasks.

- **Image-Omics Contrastive Learning Methods**: Worked on innovative image-omics contrastive learning methods by adapting [OpenAI's CLIP](https://openai.com/research/clip) in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio from joint embeddings of image and transcriptomics datasets. 


#### :microscope: An example of my approach to Problem-Solving:

Recently, I've showcased a pragmatic approach to predicting **RNA openness** through machine learning. I tackled the challenge by defining RNA accessibility based on backbone flexibility, using data from RNA probing experiments. I consulted experts in mRNA vaccine development to refine the definition and gained stakeholder approval. By analyzing data, I showed clear differences in flexibility between open and base-paired regions. My approach allowed translating an abstract question of defining accessible regions on an RNA into a concrete **regression** task that could be solved using a wealth of inhouse and external biological datasets.
