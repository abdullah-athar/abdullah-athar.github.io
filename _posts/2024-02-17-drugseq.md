## Role: Data Science and AI Associate

### Team: Compound Screening for Drug Discovery

#### Collaborations:
- Carragher Lab, Edinburgh
- Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard


## Overview
In my role as a Data Science and AI Associate within the Compound Screening for Drug Discovery team, I developed data models and pipelines for high-content profiling methodologies aimed at expediting the drug discovery process.

## Achievements
- Recognized with a Gold Award from GSK for significant contributions.
- Received a £1500 award for employee recognition due to the impactful results delivered.

## Outreach Initiatives

In addition to my project work, I was also actively involved in STEM outreach initiatives. I had the opportunity to introduce many under resourced sixth form students to the fields of AI, machine learning, and data science through the *leaders in STEM* program. By giving them an insight into the work I was doing, I aimed to inspire and engage these students, demonstrating the potential of these rapidly evolving fields.

## Project Details
While most of the project details are proprietary, I summarise below some of the details of my work. Please feel free to reach out if you have further questions, or are interested in certain aspects of the work.

**Data Handling and Analysis**
- Leveraged data from DRUG-seq for miniaturized high-throughput transcriptome profiling in drug discovery.
- Developed and implemented robust data normalization, visualization, and modeling strategies.
- Utilized Bayesian methods, particularly the Bayesian Group Factor Analysis framework, to integrate data from various sources effectively.

**Automation and Scalability**
- Established scalable data pipelines to streamline project workflows.
- Automated metadata capture and integrated database inputs via APIs, reducing human errors and enhancing efficiency and accuracy.


During the course of this project, I developed several key capabilities:

- UI/UX Design: I worked on designing user-friendly interfaces and experiences.
- Writing Production-Ready Code: I ensured that the code I wrote was ready for production use, following best practices for efficiency and maintainability.
- Agile Development: I worked within an Agile development framework, which allowed for iterative progress and flexibility.
- Data integrity and data quality good practices.
