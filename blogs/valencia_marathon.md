If you’ve ever tried running in Lahore, Pakistan, you’ll know that it’s not just about lacing up your shoes and putting one foot in front of the other. The heat, the humidity, and the traffic alone are enough to make it feel more like an obstacle course than a steady training routine. Add in the poor air quality and limited access to safe running routes, and it quickly becomes clear why distance running in Lahore is such a challenge.

But recently, I managed something I’m still trying to wrap my head around: finishing the Valencia Marathon in a personal best time of 2 hours and 41 minutes. Given where I come from—both geographically and in terms of training—this feels like a meaningful achievement.

## The Challenge of Training in Lahore

Lahore is a city rich in culture and history, but as a runner, you face a distinct set of hurdles:

1. **Air Quality & Pollution:** The smog and dust can make it tough to take in a proper, clean breath.
2. **Unpredictable Weather:** Sweltering summers and foggy winters both demand adaptability and caution.
3. **Crowded Streets:** Congestion leaves little room for a relaxed long run, making early mornings almost the only option.
4. **Limited Infrastructure:** Footpaths are uneven, green spaces limited, and traffic patterns can feel chaotic.

Training under these conditions can shape you into a more resilient runner. Every run is a test of will: wake up earlier, adjust your pace, find a safer route, improvise, and keep moving forward.

## Moving to Hitchin: A Breath of Fresh Air

A few years ago, my life shifted, when I moved to the UK. The difference was like stepping into another running universe. The cooler climate, accessible trails, and cleaner air allowed me to focus on fine-tuning my running economy instead of just surviving each session. The sense of community with other local runners was encouraging. This supportive environment helped build consistency, which I believe played a huge role in my performance at the Valencia Marathon.

## The Valencia Marathon: A Journey of Emotions

On race day in Valencia, the conditions were nearly perfect. I was surrounded by runners from all over the world, all with their own stories, their own difficulties left behind to chase a goal in this vibrant Spanish city.

- **At 31K and 39K, Tears Came:** Not out of pain, but out of the dawning realization that “I can do this.” Those were powerful moments that caught me off-guard, especially when right before the second time, I spotted my wife cheering me on. Her unwavering support, both on and off the course, reminded me why I was here.
- **Unexpected Struggles:** My heart rate monitor’s band chafed my lats, leading to bleeding through my top and onto my once-white shoes. The blood wasn’t a deterrent but a reminder that the body, and the mind, were fully engaged in this effort.
- **The Finish Line and the Best Paella:** Crossing the finish line was surreal. After months of training and thousands of kilometers, the result was a time I could hardly believe. And the reward? An authentic Valencian paella to top it all off. It was a fitting tribute to a day I’ll never forget.

## Reflecting on the 2:41 Finish

The marathon block started on treadmills and jogging tracks in Lahore, where running tests your grit in every way. It continued in Hitchin, where opportunity and environment helped me refine my craft. It ended in Valencia, where the race itself was an emotional tapestry.

The race itself was just a victory lap--it's the endless training loops around butts close, the tuesday sessions with the boys and the long runs with the Kate on the bike that made it incredible.
