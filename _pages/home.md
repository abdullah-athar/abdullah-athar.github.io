## 🚀 Professional Summary
Experienced AI/ML engineer with a strong passion for mathematical modeling and computational techniques. Whether it's analyzing complex biological systems or building cutting-edge machine learning solutions, I thrive on turning tough problems into real-world solutions. My journey from Lahore to Cambridge, filled with challenges and learning, has shaped how I approach problems. I don't just enjoy solving puzzles—I need to. That constant curiosity, the voice in my head pushing me to figure things out, keeps me going, growing and learning. I love collaborating on innovative projects that push the boundaries of AI, machine learning, and software engineering. If there's a hard problem to crack, I'm all in.

## 👋 About me

My journey started in Pakistan, where an early fascination with technology and its power to change lives led me to Cambridge for a double major in Information and Bioengineering. In addition to my academic pursuits, I fully embraced Cambridge life: rowing on the River Cam, playing mixed netball (which led to meeting my partner—we’re getting married in April 2025!!), and spending time walking and training dogs. I definitely abided by my chemistry teacher's mantra of "make sure to milk the institution for all it's worth and not just the education".


I received a scholarship from [The Vicky Noon Foundation](https://www.noon-foundation.org) to study an integrated Masters in Information Engineering and Machine Learning from the University of Cambridge where I graduated with a **starred distinction**, **ranking 10th** out of a cohort of 370. While at university, I've had a broad range of experiences:
- 🛡️ Working at [BAE systems](https://www.baesystems.com/en/home) on their helmet mounted displays
- 🧬 Researching in Nobel Laureate Sir John Gurdon's lab on deriving features from images of perturbed frog cells

*Working with biological data is very humbling, as every data-related assumption is challenged by the inconsistencies created by intrinsic noise within biological systems. It has been a steep learning curve, and I have thoroughly enjoyed every part of it.*


Witnessing terminal illness first-hand in my family led me to apply AI/ML to drug discovery. Next stop after cambridge was [GSK](https://www.gsk.ai), where other than being the friendly face of the “We are GSK” global Workplace group, some of my other (perhaps comparably smaller 😃) achievements include winning an LLM hackathon and successfully supporting various ML engineering projects. Before I left, I got the opportunity to work on an exciting challenge: building and scaling language models for RNA tractability in oligonucleotide therapies. 

After nearly 4 years at GSK, I am now at [Relation Therapeutics](https://www.relationrx.com/science) as a Research engineer, where I work 
on building and scaling AI models for drug discovery. My focus will be on developing and optimising cutting-edge ML models, scaling deep learning systems, 
and integrating computational tools to accelerate therapeutic discovery -- and showcasing some exciting research at various AI conferences. 

### 🏃‍♂️ Life Beyond Code
In my spare time, I enjoy:
- 🏃‍♂️ Running (and breaking records!)
- 👨‍🍳 Cooking up a storm
- 📚 Continuous learning through books, podcasts, and other media

### 🏅 Fun Fact
A little known fact about me, that I'm on a mission to make more well known: **In 2024, I set the fastest marathon time recorded by any Pakistani runner living anywhere in the world!** 🏃‍♂️🏆🇵🇰
