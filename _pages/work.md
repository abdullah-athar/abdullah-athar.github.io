title: "My Work"
tagline: "Welcome to my professional journey in the realm of machine learning and software engineering. With a focus on innovation and a passion for cutting-edge technology, I've spent the past few years at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), where I've specialized in developing ML solutions with real-world impact. From creating recommender systems for genetic targets to architecting scalable pipelines for RNA structure prediction, I've thrived on solving complex problems at the intersection of biology and technology.
<br/>
<br/>
My journey began with a Masters from the University of Cambridge, where I delved deep into the world of AI and ML. Since then, I've been driven by a desire to push the boundaries of what's possible, whether it's through classical statistics or designing novel ML architectures. Join me as I continue to explore the endless possibilities of machine learning and software engineering, one project at a time.
